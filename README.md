# My iNat Map

Building a web app for naturalist peers to view their obscured iNaturalist observations privately and as aggregates while out in the field.

## The idea

- View your own obscured observations with precise locations
- See aggregate data when exploring new areas
- Mobile-friendly for field use
- Privacy-focused (your data stays private)

## What it does right now

- Shows a map
- Can toggle between street/satellite view
- Search for places

## Built with

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- MapLibre GL JS

## Status

ðŸš§ Early stages. Working on the mapping foundation before adding iNaturalist integration.
